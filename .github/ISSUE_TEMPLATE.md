# This library is no longer maintained #

Hello and thank you for your interest in sp-pnp-js. This library is no longer actively maintained in favor of the [new libraries](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs). You will find all of the same functionality and more in the new libraries as well as a [transition guide](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/transition-guide.html) to help you migrate.

Please migrate to the new libraries and if you are still having an issue please report it in the [new issues list](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/issues) so we can help out and get you sorted. Thanks!
